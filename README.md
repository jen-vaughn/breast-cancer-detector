# breast-cancer-detector

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. This project aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of IDC.

Using Jupyter Notebook, this Breast Cancer Detector uses various convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models to determine which model features can be used to best predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on histopathological breast tissue images from a 277,524 PNG image dataset from Kaggle. Some key Python libraries used were NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Keras.
